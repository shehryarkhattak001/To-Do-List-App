# To-Do List App (Frontend)

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up the Frontend

First, create a folder named **`frontend`**, then inside it, I initialized a Vue.js project with Vite by running the following command:

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue
```

After the project was successfully set up, I installed the necessary dependencies using:

```sh
npm install
```
